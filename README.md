This repository highlights my Power BI learning journey as I explore the complete end-to-end data analysis process, starting from ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) to data visualization and storytelling. I began learning Power BI out of my own curiosity and deep passion for transforming raw, unstructured data into meaningful and interactive insights that can drive smarter and data-informed decisions. Through this learning process, I have gained hands-on experience in data cleaning and transformation using Power Query, creating KPIs and DAX measures, building interactive dashboards with filters, slicers, maps, and charts, and presenting clear business insights through powerful visual stories.

I have explored and practiced a variety of concepts and tools including Power BI Desktop, Power Query for ETL, DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), data modeling, data visualization and storytelling, and KPI design using maps, charts, cards, and tables. Each project included here showcases a different aspect of my analytical thinking and visualization skills. My first project, the Meesho Sales Analysis Dashboard, focuses on analyzing sales performance, profit trends, and product categories using region-wise and product-wise sales visuals, dynamic KPIs for Total Sales, Profit, and Orders, and profit vs. discount analysis to identify top-performing regions and products driving the highest revenue. The second project, the Student Score Dashboard, focuses on academic analytics — tracking student performance across subjects using interactive filters for gender, class, and subject, KPIs for average scores and pass percentages, and conditional formatting for easy performance comparison, ultimately providing a clear performance overview for educators and management. The third project, the ETL & Data Transformation Project, demonstrates my understanding of the Power Query process, where I handled missing values, removed duplicates, cleaned data, and created calculated columns and measures, preparing a structured dataset ready for visualization and analysis.

All dashboard snapshots are shared as screenshots within this repository to visualize my progress and demonstrate how each Power BI report evolved as I learned advanced visualization techniques, interactive features, and KPI design. This repository also serves as a reflection of my continuous learning mindset — as I continue exploring advanced DAX formulas, row-level security (RLS), real-time dashboards, Power BI Service for cloud publishing, and even integrating Power BI with Python and R for enhanced analytics.

This entire journey represents my self-paced learning path as an aspiring Data Analyst, aimed at strengthening my data storytelling and visualization skills, understanding business-oriented insights, and building a professional portfolio that reflects real-world analytical thinking and practical Power BI proficiency. Each project here reflects both my growth and curiosity in using data to tell meaningful stories that inspire action.
