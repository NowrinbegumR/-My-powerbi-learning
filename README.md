Power BI Learning Journey – Data Analytics & Visualization Projects

A collection of interactive, insightful dashboards and data analysis projects created using Microsoft Power BI. This repository documents my learning journey as a Data Analyst in training, exploring the complete data analysis lifecycle — from ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) to Data Cleaning, Modeling, KPI Creation, and Dashboard Visualization.

Each project here represents my growth, curiosity, and passion for turning raw datasets into meaningful insights that tell a data-driven story.
